- 👋 Hi there! I'm Rupert aka Brightfame. I have a diploma in Civil Engineering and have been a Civil Contractor for the last 15 years. I made a conscious decision a few months back to make a career change. It's drastic and risky, however, I'm committed and have a vision, and the drive, to become a Data Consulting Specialist in Namibia.
- 👀 I've always been passionate about music. Oh, I love frequencies and vibrations... I can go on and on, almost did. Long long, long story short. My true passion is to produce music, to be a sound engineer, and to understand and manipulate frequencies to good vibes, and that led to my interest in programming, hence data first. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning data analytics, as my priority, or career track path, to Data Science and data engineering. That's the plan, vision and goal. Data Specialist Consultant, hence, "BrightFameLabs Data Consultants", in Namibia. I need to say it, Namibia, as data information and its power of change in the right direction, has not been realized in its complexity and worth. Data is everything...
- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my interest to fulfil my vision and aspiration to establish and grow ' BrightFameLabs Data Consulting'. My interest at the moment is Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Data visualization and analysis (Python, Pandas, Matplotlib), any and Open source contributions.
